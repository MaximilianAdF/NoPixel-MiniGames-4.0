  <p align="center">↑ Click to play ↑</p>

   ### Description
   The new Roof Running job that recently popped up on NoPixel 4.0 is built around stealing AC units from the roof's of buildings. Stealing the AC units require a screwdriver which through the above minigame loosens the AC unit and lets the player pick it up. The game consists of a 11x8 grid with 88 differently colored cubes (Red, Green Blue). Cubes of the same color that are connected (Meaning more than 2 cubes are next to one another) can be removed by clicking on them. The remaining cubes fall downwards and align to the left of the screen. Singular cubes of a specific color can not be removed since they're not a pair of more than 2. The game is completed succesfully if all cubes have been removed within the time constraint.

   ### Thoughts
   There are still some stuff that could be nice to add
   - Highscore, Current score interface (global?)

  <p align="center">↑ Click to play ↑</p>

  ### Description
  The thermite minigame is based on the hack that is triggered when disabling lasers in the Maze Bank on NoPixel 4.0. The minigame offers two presets: the Maze Bank sewers generators and the Maze Bank vault. The game can also be configured through the settings. You can alter the grid size (Rows x Columns), Timer duration and the Target Score.

  <p align="center">↑ Click to play ↑</p>

  ### Description
  The chopping minigame utilizes the same concept as the [SmokeCrack](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-MiniGames-4.0#LockPick) minigame where you're tasked to enter all the letters in the correct order before the timer runs out. The game with this UI is triggered whenever you're trying to break into a civ's car. It appears when amplifying the car key's signal from outside their house to then be able to unlock the car. The letters are randomly generated but can only be chosen from the following characters ["q", "w", "e", "r", "a", "s", "d"], tapping any other keys on your keyboard will not affect the minigame. The original letter count is set to 15 and the timer is set to 7 seconds.

  ### Description
  SmokeCrack is the **new** 'Wi-Fi Hacking' app that can be found on the NoPixel 4.0 computer, It's price is 3BUTCOIN. The app seemed to be malfunctioning upon it's initial release, for instance, the Timer visually stopping but never actually stopping (causing all attempts to result in 'Hacking failed!'). Thankfully the minor bugs were quickly patched. here's some examples of it's __functionality__:

  <p align="center">↑ Click to play ↑</p>
  
  ### Description
  LockPicking played a major role in NoPixel 3.0 but was a fairly simple hack. In NoPixel 4.0 it has now transformed into a more complex yet more intuitive hack. The uses of lockpicking have not yet been fully explored nor "released" to the server. The lockpick's objective is to crack each of the 4 "locks" (circles) by aligning the balls with their corresponding color indicators. The hack is less forgiving than previous iterations and has a 20 seconds time-duration before the lockpick gets bent. Clips of the lockpick in __action__:

   <p align="center">↑ Click to play ↑</p>
   
   ### Description
   A simple twist to the pre existing [LockPick](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-MiniGames-4.0#LockPick) hack. This is the hack that is required to complete in order to open the money safe in the back of the Laundromat in NoPixel 4.0. The difference between this minigame and the [LockPick](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-MiniGames-4.0#LockPick) is the addition of an extra lock-circle, now totaling five and a decrease in time from roughly 20 seconds down to 10. You can also easily alter the timer yourself if you'd like to practice even faster or slower lockpick variations.

- ## 🔗 [RepairKit v.1.0.1](https://maximilianadf.github.io/NoPixel-MiniGames-4.0/RepairKit/RepairKit.html)
   [![Screenshot 2024-02-07 at 13 27 40](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-MiniGames-4.0/assets/63980031/ac828de8-fb5d-4c9f-97ac-ee000702b630)](https://no-px.vercel.app/puzzles/repair-kit)
  <p align="center">↑ Click to play ↑</p>
  
  ### Description
  The RepairKit game has the same functionality in 4.0 as it did in 3.0. The difference is the minigame's apperance/ui which has been revamped and turned into a more sophisticated design. It's a simple MiniGame of timing your button press correctly to align the moving square with the indicated slot. It's substantialy easier than the other MiniGames of this repository.

  ### Thoughts
  The coloring can use some touches to make it more like it's NoPixel 4.0 counterpart. Furthermore adding a highsore, current score counter alongside a possible difficulty setting that alters the moving-speed of the square. Will be justified in future versions. Problem where you can press E multiple times causing a speedup/buggy next game
