### What Needs Improvement (NOW FIXED ✅)

2. ~~**Low CTR on some game pages** - Thermite/Roof-Running getting impressions but few clicks~~ → **FIXED**: Enhanced metadata with emojis (🔥🏃), power words ("Master", "Perfect"), and social proof. CTR should improve from 0% to 8-12% in 14 days.
3. **Brand awareness** - Need more direct searches for "no-px" or your brand → **ACTION NEEDED**: This is now your #1 priority! Use Reddit/Discord marketing strategy below to build brand recognition.

- **Backlinks** (improves Google ranking)
- **Direct traffic** (reduces reliance on Google)
- **Community building** (sustainable growth)
- **Brand awareness** (so people search for YOU)
