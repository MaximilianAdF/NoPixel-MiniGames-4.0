            <p>
                The Lockpick minigame is one of the most fundamental skills in NoPixel 4.0, representing 
                the mechanical process of bypassing vehicle and property locks. This timing-based challenge 
                tests your reflexes and precision as you stop a moving indicator within a narrow target zone. 
                Success means access to locked vehicles, properties, and restricted areas throughout Los Santos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lockpicking isn&apos;t just a one-time skill - it&apos;s used hundreds of times throughout 
                a criminal&apos;s career in NoPixel. From stealing your first car to breaking into high-security 
                buildings, mastering this minigame is absolutely essential for any aspiring criminal character.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#54FFA4]">How to Play - Detailed Breakdown</h3>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Observe the lock mechanism</strong> - You&apos;ll see a circular or linear indicator sweeping back and forth</li>
                <li><strong>Identify the target zone</strong> - Look for the green/highlighted area where you need to stop</li>
                <li><strong>Watch the indicator&apos;s speed</strong> - Note how fast it moves and establish rhythm</li>
                <li><strong>Time your click</strong> - Press SPACE or CLICK when the indicator enters the target zone</li>
                <li><strong>Aim for center</strong> - Hitting dead-center of the zone awards maximum points</li>
                <li><strong>Continue for multiple pins</strong> - Most locks require 2-5 successful picks in sequence</li>
                <li><strong>Complete without mistakes</strong> - Missing the zone breaks your lockpick and fails the attempt</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#54FFA4]">Scoring System Explained</h3>
            <p>
                Your lockpicking performance is measured across several dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Precision score</strong> - Closer to dead-center = higher points (Perfect center = 100 points)</li>
                <li><strong>Speed bonus</strong> - Quick successive picks build time bonuses</li>
                <li><strong>Streak multiplier</strong> - Consecutive perfect picks multiply your score</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty modifier</strong> - Harder locks with faster indicators award better scores</li>
                <li><strong>First-attempt success</strong> - Completing on your first try adds completion bonuses</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#54FFA4]">Professional Tips & Techniques</h3>
            <p>
                Experienced lockpickers use these advanced strategies to achieve consistent success:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Predictive timing</strong> - Don&apos;t react to the indicator; predict where it will be and click preemptively</li>
                <li><strong>Rhythm establishment</strong> - Find the beat/tempo of the indicator and click in rhythm</li>
                <li><strong>Visual tracking</strong> - Keep your eyes focused on the target zone, not the moving indicator</li>
                <li><strong>Peripheral awareness</strong> - Use peripheral vision to track indicator speed</li>
                <li><strong>Input lag compensation</strong> - Account for your mouse/keyboard delay (usually 20-40ms)</li>
                <li><strong>Audio cues utilization</strong> - If sounds are enabled, use audio feedback to improve timing</li>
                <li><strong>Breathing technique</strong> - Exhale as you click to maintain steady hands</li>
                <li><strong>Practice at different speeds</strong> - Don&apos;t only practice one difficulty level</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#54FFA4]">Difficulty Tiers and What They Mean</h3>
            <p>
                NoPixel features multiple lock types with varying difficulty levels:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Class D Locks</strong> - Slow indicator, large target zone, 1-2 pins (civilian vehicles)</li>
                <li><strong>Class C Locks</strong> - Moderate speed, medium zone, 2-3 pins (standard vehicles, basic doors)</li>
                <li><strong>Class B Locks</strong> - Fast indicator, small zone, 3-4 pins (luxury vehicles, commercial properties)</li>
                <li><strong>Class A Locks</strong> - Very fast, tiny zone, 4-5 pins (high-end vehicles, secure buildings)</li>
                <li><strong>Class S Locks</strong> - Extreme speed, minimal zone, 5+ pins (maximum security locations)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each lock class in NoPixel corresponds to different vehicle or property types. Practicing 
                higher difficulties prepares you for the most lucrative criminal opportunities.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#54FFA4]">Common Mistakes That Cost Lockpicks</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Clicking too early</strong> - Nervousness causes premature clicks; stay calm and wait</li>
                <li><strong>Overcompensating after misses</strong> - Don&apos;t wildly adjust your timing after one failure</li>
                <li><strong>Not accounting for input lag</strong> - Test your system&apos;s response time and adjust accordingly</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring indicator patterns</strong> - Some locks have variable speeds; watch for pattern changes</li>
                <li><strong>Losing focus between pins</strong> - Maintain concentration through all pins, not just the first</li>
                <li><strong>Trying to react instead of predict</strong> - Prediction beats reaction every time at higher speeds</li>
                <li><strong>Poor mouse sensitivity</strong> - Too high sensitivity can cause accidental clicks</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#54FFA4]">NoPixel Roleplay Applications</h3>
            <p>
                Lockpicking is used constantly throughout NoPixel criminal roleplay for:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">

                <li><strong>Gang warfare</strong> - Breaking into rival gang territories and stash houses</li>
                <li><strong>Prison escapes</strong> - Some escape routes require lockpicking skills</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#54FFA4]">Equipment and Material Costs</h3>
            <p>
                In NoPixel, lockpicks are consumable items with varying quality and cost:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Basic Lockpicks</strong> - $50-100 each, break easily, good for Class D/C locks</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Lockpicks</strong> - $200-300 each, more durable, handle Class B/A locks</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Lockpicks</strong> - $500+ each, rarely break, required for Class S locks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
                Your equipment significantly affects lockpicking performance:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Mouse DPI settings</strong> - Lower DPI (400-800) provides better click control</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor refresh rate</strong> - Higher Hz (144Hz+) shows smoother indicator movement</li>
                <li><strong>Input device quality</strong> - Gaming mice with low latency improve timing accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard vs mouse</strong> - Test both SPACE and CLICK to find your preference</li>
                <li><strong>Wired connections</strong> - Eliminate wireless input lag for competitive advantage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#54FFA4]">Controls Reference</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>SPACE BAR</strong> - Attempt to pick the current pin (recommended for consistency)<br/>
                <strong>LEFT CLICK</strong> - Alternative pick method (some players prefer mouse clicking)<br/>
                <strong>ESC</strong> - Cancel lockpick attempt (forfeit the lockpick)
